# timey-wimey
Lets you modify how frequently time updates in minecraft (default is every tick).

Usage:  
`/tmod <day|night> 2` -> makes the day/night 2 ticks instead of one
`/tmod get` -> displays current settings  
`/tmod toggle` -> toggles the time modifiers on/off  

The day is the time from 0 until 12000 and the night is from 12000 until 0 

I coded this in a couple of hours, so forgive the sloppy quality.
