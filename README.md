# NotEnoughTime
Lets you modify the flow of time. 
The modifier value can be a positive or negative float, and make the time move faster, slower, or even backwards.

Usage:  
`/tmod <day|night> 2` -> makes the day/night 2 times faster  
`/tmod get` -> displays current settings  
`/tmod toggle` -> toggles the time modifiers on/off  

The day is the time from 0 until 12000 and the night is from 12000 until 0
