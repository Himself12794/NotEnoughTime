# timey-wimey
Lets you modify how many ticks a minecraft time unit is. (Default is 6 ticks per unit)

Usage:
/tmod <day|night> 1.5 -> makes the day/night 1.5 times longer 
/tmod get -> displays current settings
/tmod toggle -> toggles the time modifiers on/off

The day is the time from 0 until 12000 and the night is from 12000 until 0 (Time resets to 0 at 24000). 
By default, a minecraft unit of time is 6 ticks, and each tick is 0.05 seconds
